                      The IKTVA program in Saudi Arabia, initiated by Aramco, drives localization in the oil and gas sector by increasing local content in goods and services. It necessitates suppliers to elevate their locally produced share, boosting the domestic economy by fostering job growth and technology transfer while reinforcing the country's supply chain. Compliance with IKTVA is pivotal for companies seeking to engage in Aramco projects, compelling them to adapt and enhance capabilities to meet local content requisites, as failure to comply can result in exclusion from lucrative contracts. Ultimately, IKTVA significantly shapes the competitive landscape for businesses operating or entering the Saudi market.                    </div>
